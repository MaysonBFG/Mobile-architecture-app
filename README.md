# Mobile-architecture-app

This application was a final project Mobile architecture and programming class. In this class we where required to create three main components in our project : a login screen, a grid system so the user can view data submitted into an SQL database and a feature that requests SMS permissions. All three should be present in my application and all three features are really quite standard in many applications and it was useful to know how to structure and implement these screens becuase they are common requests from users wanting a mobile app, I also used a unique process for the login screen, I decided to take an extremely minimalist approach on this porject and as a result I just used a data base to store usernames and compare them to new usernames trying to be created, although if we are going to be totally offline we dont even need this, you could be able to create a username that is a duplicate of another so long as we never have plans to bring some sort of interconnected back end into the app, I chose to use the comparing function in case we should decide to give our app online functonality. I tested the code as I usually do, making sure there are no errors popping up in the lines of my program then testing it and playing around in it to make sure nothing is acting funny, im sure I could have added in some debugging lines that would print out into the terminal but I never had a problem I needed that for. I like the database system the most, I thought it was slick to use SQL to create a database back end for data then using that in the front end to make a scrollable UI compnent that will display the data.
